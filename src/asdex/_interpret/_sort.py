    """Sort reorders elements along one dimension.

    Each output element depends on all input elements in its slice
    along the sort dimension,
    since any input could end up at any position after sorting.

    For input shape (*batch, n) sorted along the last axis:
        out[*b, j] depends on all in[*b, :]

    For multiple operands (multi-key sort via ``lax.sort``),
    the permutation is determined by all key inputs jointly,
    so deps from all operands in the same slice are unioned.

    Example: y = sort(x, dimension=1) where x.shape = (2, 3)
        Input deps:  [{0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}]
        Output deps: [{0, 1, 2}, {0, 1, 2}, {0, 1, 2},
                      {3, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}]

        invars: one or more operand arrays (all same shape)
        dimension: axis along which to sort
        is_stable: whether sort is stable (irrelevant for sparsity)
        num_keys: number of key operands (irrelevant for sparsity)
