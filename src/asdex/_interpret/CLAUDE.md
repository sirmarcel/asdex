# _interpret — Custom Jaxpr Interpreter for Index Set Propagation

Implements a custom jaxpr interpreter that propagates per-element dependency index sets (`set[int]`)
through primitives to determine Jacobian sparsity patterns.

## Key Types

- `IndexSets` = `list[set[int]]` — per-element dependency sets for one array
- `Deps` = `dict[Var, IndexSets]` — maps jaxpr variables to their index sets
- `ConstVals` = `dict[Var, np.ndarray]` — statically-known values for precise gather/scatter

## Naming Conventions

**Terminology** — "indices" and "map" mean different things:
- **"indices" / "index sets"**: `IndexSets` (`list[set[int]]`),
  the per-element dependency sets used for sparsity tracking.
- **"map"**: numpy integer arrays that map output positions to input positions.
  Not index sets.

**Variable names** — use these consistently across handlers:
- `in_indices`: input index sets (from `index_sets(deps, atom)`)
- `in_shape`: input array shape (from `atom_shape(atom)`)
- `permutation_map`: the flat integer array passed to `permute_indices()`
- `in_position_map`: when a `position_map()` result is stored
  (e.g., reused across loop iterations in `_split.py`)

**Docstrings** — avoid the term "deps"; prefer "index sets" or "input index sets".

## Common Utilities in `_commons.py`

- **`position_map(shape)`** —
  builds an array where each element holds its own flat position.
  Applying operations (transpose, slice, flip) to this array
  reveals which input position each output position reads from.
- **`permute_indices(in_indices, permutation_map)`** —
  builds output index sets by copying from input positions according to a map.
  Used by handlers where each output reads exactly one input element
  (transpose, rev, slice, reshape, broadcast, split, tile, gather, dynamic_slice).
- **`fixed_point_loop(iterate_fn, carry, n_carry)`** —
  runs a body function on carry index sets until they stabilize.
  Used by `while_loop` and `scan`.
- **`conservative_indices(all_indices, out_size)`** —
  conservative fallback where every output element depends on the union of all inputs.

## Const Value Tracking

Handlers like `broadcast_in_dim`, `select_n`, and binary ops propagate concrete values through `const_vals`.
This lets `gather`/`scatter` resolve static indices precisely instead of falling back to conservative.

## Adding a New Handler

1. Write `prop_<name>(eqn, deps, ...)` in the appropriate module.
2. Add a `case` branch in `prop_dispatch`.
3. Remove from the fallback `case` group if upgrading from conservative.
4. Add tests in the corresponding `tests/_interpret/test_<module>.py` file.

## Tests

Each handler module `_foo.py` has a corresponding test file `tests/_interpret/test_foo.py`.

## Writing Style

Use **semantic line breaks** everywhere:
one sentence or clause per line in docstrings, comments, and markdown.
This applies to all prose, not just docstrings.

Focus comments on **why**, not what.
Explain why a branch exists, why a particular approach was chosen, or why a fallback is needed.
Don't narrate what the code already says.

### Handler Docstring Style

1. **Semantic summary**: What the operation does and how dependencies flow.
2. **Math**: The Jacobian structure in concise mathematical notation.
3. **Example**: A concrete input/output trace showing dependency sets before and after.
4. **Jaxpr**: The `eqn.invars` and `eqn.params` layout the handler reads.
5. **URL**: Link to the JAX docs for the primitive, as a bare URL on the last line.
